10/31/23
HIGH PRIORITY
1. Have daily calories change based on the date the user clicks on in the calendar
2. Tie daily calories per day to userID
4. Tie calorie goal to USERID
5. Implement userID into the registration process
6. Implement all of the above into SQL

LOW PRIORITY
1. Overhaul the appearance of windows forms to make them more appealing	and navigatable
2. Have some way of letting the user know when they're over their calorie goal(maybe through changing color of text i.e. green->red)
3. Show whether the user completes their daily calorie goal per day, week, month, year; probably base this on daily calorie goal(maybe show it via percent(%))
4. Clean up code
